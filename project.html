        <h1>Backtracking</h1>
        <p> Backtracking is a form of recursion. <br><br>
            The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you
            must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of
            options
            you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final
            state.
            If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't. <br><br>
            Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves,
            though it may be
            that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the
            root,
            you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf. <br><br>
            Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your
            most recent choice, and
            trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you
            here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good
            leaves to be found.
        </p>

        <p>This needs an example.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
            <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
            <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
            <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
            <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
            <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
            <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>
            In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of
            choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data
            structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it
            is called depth-first tree searching.)
        </h4>

        <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
        <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n)
             { if n is a leaf node { 
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true 
                else return false 
            } else { 
            for each child c of n {
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                } 
                return false 
                }
                }
        </pre>

        <h4>
            Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the
            algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes
            on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no
            path that includes n to any goal node.
        </h4>

        <h5>How does this work?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
            <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do
            is test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code,
            this is done by the lines
        </p>

        <pre>
            for each child c of n {
            if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            } 
            return false
        </pre>
        <h2>Keeping backtracking simple</h2>
        <p>
            All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex: 
            <br><br>
            for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions 
            <br><br>
            To keep the program clean, therefore, <strong>Strong tag hed</strong> like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b>gameOver</b> method (or you could even call it isLeaf). This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
